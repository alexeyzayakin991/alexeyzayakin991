## Hi there 👋

  My name is Alexey and I am an indie game developer.

  My dream is to make a game that's a cross between C&C Generals, Spore, Factorio, Minecraft, Stronghold Crusader, Cossacks, Foxhole, and Planetary Annihilation.
  The game's main feature is that the player "creates" the game themselves. How? The game will feature a built-in editor for various types of objects, such as buildings, vehicles, weapons, clothing, and the like (there will also be a standard set of objects for players to use).
  
  Now about the game itself.

  Title " * * * " (submitted by the developer)

  Genre: Real-time strategy (RTS) with elements of crafting, construction, management, and society simulation.

  Description:
  The player is immersed in an alternate, fictional world, stylized as the period from the late 19th century to 1945. In this world, players don't just command armies and build bases—they become the architect of their own game, creating unique items, weapons, buildings, vehicles, and even entire factions with their own social structures. Players begin the game on a procedurally generated planet with a small settlement. They harvest resources, build production chains, master new technologies, create military units, and set out to conquer the world.

  Key Features:
1. Built-in Content Editor (Game Creator Mode)
- The player creates their own items: weapons, clothing, vehicles, buildings, and infrastructure.
- The editor allows you to customize the parameters, appearance, functionality, and interactions of objects.
- Created objects can be immediately used in the game world, tested, and modified.
- Ability to share created content with other players (future online/community).

2. Faction system with social layers (expandable):
- Governor/President/Emperor (the player chooses the title and role) — strategic leadership, key decision-making.
- Government — ministers of economy, defense, science, infrastructure, etc.
- Military — units responsible for defense and offense.
- Workers — the bulk of the population, engaged in resource extraction, production, and construction.
- Additional classes (optional by player or scenario): scientists, engineers, merchants, scouts, diplomats.
- Interaction between layers affects faction effectiveness, morale, economy, and military might.

3. Unit scale and proportionality
- All objects and units have realistic proportions: people, buildings, transport, and various other items.
- Population scale directly impacts production capacity and military strength.
- A large population means more labor, which allows for faster development of infrastructure and the military.

4. Procedurally Generated Planet
- The game map is an entire planet with diverse biomes, climates, and terrain.
- Each launch is a unique planet with different geography, resources, and strategic points.
- Map scalability from local regions to the global level.

5. Terraforming and Geoengineering:
The player can modify the landscape:
- Dig trenches to create reservoirs or canals.
- Fill in reservoirs to expand territory.
- Build tunnels and roads through mountains.
- Build dams, levees, and irrigation systems.
Terraforming affects resource availability, strategic opportunities, and settlement development.

6. Resources and Economy
- A wide variety of resources: coal, iron, oil, timber, food, rare metals, etc.
- A complex economic system with production chains, trade, and logistics.
- The impact of politics and military action on the economy and resource availability.

7. Military Action and Tactics
- A variety of units: infantry, cavalry, artillery, armored vehicles, and aircraft (depending on the era).
- Tactical capabilities: fortifications, ambushes, encirclements, and terrain exploitation.
- The impact of morale, supply, and command on troop effectiveness.

8. Technological Development and Progress
- Research and innovation affecting weapons, production, transportation, and social institutions.
- The ability to create unique technologies and vehicles in the editor.
- Technological progress reflects the historical period, but with alternative development paths.

Roadmap (being updated):
1. Rough development of the procedurally generated planet (NOW HERE). Up to 1 month.

2. Rough development of the game interface. Up to 1 week.

3. Rough development of Game Creator Mode. Up to 2 weeks.

4. Developing the resources used in the game and adding them to Game Creator Mode. Up to 2 months.

5. Adding resources for the procedurally generated planet. Terraforming. Up to 1 month.

6. Final development of Game Creator Mode. Up to 1 month.

7. Final development of the procedurally generated planet. Up to 1 month.

8. Final development of the game interface. Up to 1 month.

9. Optimization. Bug fixes. Updates. From 1 week to 3 months.


I'll be posting photos and videos as the game progresses.
